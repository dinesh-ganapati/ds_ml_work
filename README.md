Musings of Software Engineer turned Prodcut Manager. Here are some ML problems I solved over time. Each of these problems have an associated data set and a problem statement.
I did not want to commit the notebook or the py files and instead converted them to html before putting them out here in order to keep some of the formatting clean.
Feel free to download these try them out.
I ran all of these on jupyter notebook on a conda env.
